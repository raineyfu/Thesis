In summary, the novel technique introduced for encoding CV and DPV data represents a pivotal advancement in the realm of SDLs. Shown through accurately segmenting voltammograms based on their characteristics and demonstrated efficacy across various machine learning tasks, including clustering, classification, denoising, and synthetic data generation, this technique signifies a significant step towards autonomous SDLs. Furthermore, its versatility extends beyond SDLs and can be applied to any 2-dimensional data. Moving forward, further exploration into alternative curve simplification algorithms and integration of the encoding technique into operational SDL frameworks stand as promising avenues for future research and development.
