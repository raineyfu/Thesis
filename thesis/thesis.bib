abstract = {Abstract Polarography is still the best known classical measuring method in electroanalytical chemistry. However, in recent years its position has been challenged by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Simple diagnostic criteria and relatively easily acquired measuring techniques have hastened this development. Cyclic voltammetry has the further attraction of providing information not only on the thermodynamics of redox processes but also on the kinetics of heterogeneous electron-transfer reactions and coupled chemical reactions. The characteristic shapes of the voltammetric waves and their unequivocal position on the potential scale virtually fingerprint the individual electrochemical properties of redox systems. For this reason the method has been labeled “electrochemical spectroscopy”.},

This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters.}

The most popular convolution neural networks for object detection and object category classification from images are Alex Nets, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. A variety of image data sets are available to test the performance of different types of CNN’s. The commonly found benchmark datasets for evaluating the performance of a convolutional neural network are anImageNet dataset, and CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MNIST image data sets. This study focuses on analyzing the performance of three popular networks: Alex Net, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. We have taken three most popular data sets ImageNet, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 for our study, since, testing the performance of a network on a single data set does not reveal its true capability and limitations. It must be noted that videos are not used as a training dataset, they are used as testing datasets. Our analysis shows that GoogLeNet and ResNet50 are able to recognize objects with better precision compared to Alex Net. Moreover, theperformance of trained CNN’s vary substantially across different categories of objects and we, therefore, will discuss the possible reasons for this.}

We begin with an account of fundamental physical length scales in electrochemistry, with an emphasis on phenomena that make nanoelectrochemical measurements and their interpretation qualitatively distinct from those at larger scales. This includes modified diffusional phenomena, the increased relative significance of the electrical double layer, stochastic treatment of single entity events, unique surface atomic arrangements, nanoconfinement, quantum effects, and altered optical properties. We then give an overview of the fundamental theory of nanoscale electrochemistry, describing how standard theoretical and modeling approaches must be modified or refined to account for characteristic behavior at such small length scales. Finally, we give a general instructive account of some of the key practical challenges that are commonly encountered when performing experimental measurements on nanoelectrochemical systems.}
