abstract = {Abstract Polarography is still the best known classical measuring method in electroanalytical chemistry. However, in recent years its position has been challenged by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Simple diagnostic criteria and relatively easily acquired measuring techniques have hastened this development. Cyclic voltammetry has the further attraction of providing information not only on the thermodynamics of redox processes but also on the kinetics of heterogeneous electron-transfer reactions and coupled chemical reactions. The characteristic shapes of the voltammetric waves and their unequivocal position on the potential scale virtually fingerprint the individual electrochemical properties of redox systems. For this reason the method has been labeled “electrochemical spectroscopy”.},

abstract = {A new graphical display is proposed for partitioning techniques. Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters.}

abstract = {This paper presents an empirical analysis of theperformance of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for identifying objects in real time video feeds. The most popular convolution neural networks for object detection and object category classification from images are Alex Nets, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. A variety of image data sets are available to test the performance of different types of CNN’s. The commonly found benchmark datasets for evaluating the performance of a convolutional neural network are anImageNet dataset, and CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MNIST image data sets. This study focuses on analyzing the performance of three popular networks: Alex Net, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. We have taken three most popular data sets ImageNet, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 for our study, since, testing the performance of a network on a single data set does not reveal its true capability and limitations. It must be noted that videos are not used as a training dataset, they are used as testing datasets. Our analysis shows that GoogLeNet and ResNet50 are able to recognize objects with better precision compared to Alex Net. Moreover, theperformance of trained CNN’s vary substantially across different categories of objects and we, therefore, will discuss the possible reasons for this.}
