I am deeply thankful to my advisor Sergio Pablo-García Carrillo for his invaluable guidance, without which this project would not have been achievable. I also extend my gratitude to Prof. Alán Aspuru-Guzik for granting me the opportunity to collaborate with the Matter Lab research group at the University of Toronto.

Additionally, I express my heartfelt appreciation to Lianjiang Fu, Yuchuan Hu, Cindy Fu, and Christina Men for their unwavering support throughout this journey. Their encouragement has played a significant role in shaping who I am today.
