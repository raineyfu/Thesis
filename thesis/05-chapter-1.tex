\section{Electrochemistry}
SDLs are commonly used to perform electrochemistry experiments. Electrochemistry is the branch of chemistry that investigates electron mobility and the behavior of charged compounds in the presence of an electric field, ultimately giving rise to the phenomenon known as electricity.  The flow of electrons occurs not only through the transfer from one chemical species to another in what is called an oxidation-reduction reaction but can also be transferred through positive charges or charged species. When a substance loses an electron, its oxidation state increases, indicating oxidation. When a substance acquires an electron, its oxidation state decreases, indicating reduction. For example, consider the following redox reaction which has oxidation and reduction components:
\begin{align}
H\textsubscript{2} + F\textsubscript{2} \to 2HF
\end{align}
Oxidation:
\begin{align}
H\textsubscript{2} \to 2H\textsuperscript{+} + 2e\textsuperscript{-}
\end{align}
Reduction:
\begin{align}
F\textsubscript{2} + 2e\textsuperscript{-} \to 2F\textsuperscript{-}
\end{align}
A redox reaction is balanced when the number of electrons gained by the oxidant is equal to the number of electrons lost by the reductant. Similar to any balanced chemical equation, the entire process is electrically neutral, meaning that the net charge remains consistent on both sides of the equation.
With redox reactions, it is possible to physically separate the oxidation and reduction half-reactions in space, provided there exists a complete circuit using an external electrical link, such as a wire, connecting the two halves. As the reaction progresses, electrons migrate from the reductant to the oxidant through this electrical connection, generating an electric current. 

Devices that use redox reactions to generate electricity or use electricity to drive non-spontaneous redox reactions are called electrochemical cells. This device effectively transforms chemical energy into electrical energy or vice-versa. In an electrochemical cell, reduction and oxidation reactions take place at the electrodes. The electrode where reduction occurs is termed the cathode, while oxidation occurs at the anode. An electrode serves as a stable electrical conductor, facilitating the flow of electrical current within non-metallic solids, liquids, gases, plasmas, or even vacuums. While electrodes often exhibit high electrical conductivity, they are not limited to metals \cite{Faraday_1970}.

Electrode potential is the voltage of an electrochemical cell composed of a reference electrode and another electrode to be characterized \cite{goldbook}.

Figure \ref{cell_schematic} shows a three-electrode setup common for electrochemical experiments like cyclic voltammetry. During the flow of current between the working and counter electrodes, the reference electrode is used to precisely measure the applied potential in relation to a stable reference reaction.

\end{figure}
A potentiostat, as shown in Figure \ref{potentiostat_diagram}, is an analytical instrument designed to control the potential of the working electrode within a multi-electrode cell \cite{Zoski2006-zx}. The potentiostat contains various internal circuits tailored to fulfil this role, facilitating the generation and measurement of potentials and currents. External wires within a cell cable establish connections between the potentiostat circuit and the electrodes within the electrochemical cell. In a three-electrode configuration, the cell cable links the working, counter, and reference electrodes on one terminal and the potentiostat cell cable connector on the opposite end. The potentiostat's internal circuitry governs the applied signal. 

The working electrode performs the electrochemical event of interest. Since the event occurs at the electrode's surface, it is crucial that the electrode surface is extremely clean and that the surface area is well-defined. The working electrodes should be immediately polished after use to ensure there are no surface contaminants that inhibit electron transfer. Even a few hours of air exposure will degrade the electrode surface. Detecting when surface contamination begins to affect data quality is one of the questions this work addresses.

Potentiostats are commonly provided by commercial vendors and are typically governed by proprietary software, employ graphical user interfaces (GUI), and produce already curated data. These devices are commonly used to perform electroanalytical experiments like cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Commercial potentiostats can vary in their design, but a typical potentiostat is shown in Figure \ref{potentiostat_diagram} and consists of three component circuits: a control circuit, an electrometer, and a current follower \cite{WAIN20211}. The electrometer circuit utilizes a differential amplifier to measure the difference in potential between the working and reference electrode. Subsequently, the measured potential feeds into the control circuit, which administers a current through the counter electrode, altering the relative potential of the working electrode to align with the user-defined parameters. A single generator ensures this potential adheres to a predefined periodic waveform. The current flowing through the working electrode is then assessed by a current follower circuit, commonly in the form of a current-to-voltage converter. This circuit measures the drop in potential across a grounded resistor, allowing the current to be determined using Ohm's law.
\section{Cyclic Voltammetry}
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{cv_example}
\end{figure}
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a common electrochemical characterization that extracts important reduction and oxidation information about molecules \cite{doi:10.1021/ac60210a007}. Typically, the working electrode potential increases linearly with time. After a predetermined limit is reached, the potential decreases to return to the starting voltage. These cycles can be repeated as many times as needed to bolster confidence in the obtained data. The rate of voltage change over time is known as the experiment's scan rate (Voltage/Time) and affects how many data points are gathered throughout the experiment \cite{https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.198408313}. 

CV serves as a valuable tool for studying qualitative information about electrochemical processes across diverse conditions. It enables the examination of intermediates in oxidation-reduction reactions and the assessment of reaction reversibility. Other use cases include the determination of electron stoichiometry, analyte diffusion coefficients, and formal reduction potentials, aiding in identification processes \cite{Nicholson1964}. Additionally, in reversible, Nernstian systems, the proportional relationship between concentration and current allows for the determination of unknown solution concentrations via the construction of calibration curves correlating current and concentration \cite{Libretexts_2023}.

In a typical cyclic voltammogram shown in Figure \ref{cv_example}, peaks represent electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode surface. The anodic peak ($E_{p, a}$) is observed during the scan where oxidation of the electroactive species occurs at the electrode and corresponds to the potential at which oxidation is most favourable. The current increases as the potential applied to the electrode becomes more positive, reaching a maximum at the peak potential. The cathodic peak is observed during the reverse scan where reduction of the electroactive species occurs at the working electrode and corresponds to the potential at which reduction is most favorable. The current increases as the potential becomes more negative, reaching a maximum at the peak potential \cite{GRIMSHAW20001}. Typically, researchers are especially interested in these peaks.
\section{Differential Pulse Voltammetry}
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{DPV Voltammogram}
    \label{dpv_example}
\end{figure}
Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) is a more sophisticated electrochemical measurement technique where a series of increasing pulses are applied across the electrodes in an electrochemical cell \cite{Scholz2005-pa}. The current $I_1$ is measured right before applying the pulse at time $t_1$ and $I_2$ is measured again at the end at time $t_2$. The difference in current ($\Delta I_2 - I_1$) is plotted against the potential and results in a peak-like shape. 
This method helps reduce the impact of charging current by sampling the current just before the potential change. DPV is well suited for measurements with extremely low concentrations of chemicals. This is because the effect of the charging current can be minimized to achieve high sensitivity, and only the faradaic current, the electric current generated by the redox of a chemical at an electrode, is extracted, so electrode reactions can be measured precisely. 
Furthermore, DPV serves as a versatile tool for the qualitative characterization of chemical compounds and their electrochemical properties. By analyzing the shape, position, and area of the peaks in the DPV curve, researchers can glean insights into the nature of the electroactive species present, their concentration, kinetics of electron transfer processes, and other relevant electrochemical parameters. This capability makes DPV invaluable in various fields such as analytical chemistry, environmental monitoring, and pharmaceutical research, where understanding the behaviour of chemical compounds at the molecular level is crucial.
